# AI
## quotes for beginning
“The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.”  
― Edsger W. Dijkstra

“People worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they're too stupid and they've already taken over the world.”  
― Pedro Domingos

## AI and its goals
1. boost decision making
- The basic objective of AI is to provide a system for decision-making
- This simply means giving a certain input a certain output should be created 
- For example we say to the AI, will it rain today, the AI should analyse the weather data and give us an result like "yeah it will rain"

## timline of AI and its beginngins 

## difference between weak AI and strong AI

- Weak artificial intelligence (AI)  is a type of artificial intelligence that is limited to a specific or narrow area.
	- Weak AI lacks human consciousness, although it may be able to simulate it at times.
	- Weak AI helps turn into usable information by detecting patterns and making predictions. Examples of weak AI include Meta's (formerly Facebook) newsfeed, Amazon's suggested purchases, and Apple's Siri, the iPhone technology that 

Email spam filters are another example of weak AI; a computer uses an algorithm to learn which messages are likely to be spam, then redirects them from the inbox to the spam folder.

- Strong artificial intelligence (AI), also known as artificial general intelligence (AGI) or general AI, is a theoretical form of AI used to describe a certain mindset of AI development.
	- If researchers are able to develop Strong AI, the machine would require an intelligence equal to humans; it would have a self-aware consciousness that has the ability to solve problems, learn, and plan for the future.



## difficulties that occur in programming AI
- lack of data or data quality issues
	- for traning AI a 100 records can be enough, however, certain tasks need millions if not billions of records. The minimal size of the dataset can depend on many factors such as the complexity of the model you’re trying to build, the performance you’re aiming for, or sometimes it can even be due to the time frame that is at your disposal.
	- everyone has an subjective view on a certain area. Depending on the person you ask, you may get a different answer. some example 
- lack of computing power 
	- due to the low computing power we currently have buidling big ai moedles is very time comsumming and somtimes just immpossible
	- currently we use cloud computing - different computers comunicate with each other -  to split the computing tasks.  Therfore we are somehow able to compute big models.

### usage of boosted decision making 
1. Health care 
- qucik diagnoses of illnesses 
- more accurate
2. Fraud Prevention
- recocnicing malicious emails 
- reduce the possibility of credit card frauds takin
3. Automation
- facilitating and automating personalized messages
4. Monotoring


## ethical and legal issues of AI
### legal ??
The hierarchy of labour is concerned primarily with automation. As we’ve invented ways to automate jobs, we could create room for people to assume more complex roles, moving from the physical work that dominated the pre-industrial globe to the cognitive labour that characterizes strategic and administrative work in our globalized society.

Look at trucking: it currently employs millions of individuals in the United States alone. What will happen to them if the self-driving trucks promised by Tesla’s Elon Musk become widely available in the next decade? But on the other hand, if we consider the lower risk of accidents, self-driving trucks seem like an ethical choice. The same scenario could happen to office workers, as well as to the majority of the workforce in developed countries.

- Inequality. How do we distribute the wealth created by machines?
- Humanity. How do machines affect our behaviour and interaction?
- Evil genies. How do we protect against unintended consequences?
- Singularity. How do we stay in control of a complex intelligent system?
- Robot rights. How do we define the humane treatment of AI?

## problems and risks of AI?
- THE IMMEDIATE RISK: JOB AUTOMATION
- PRIVACY, SECURITY AND THE RISE OF 'DEEPFAKES'
- AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AND A POTENTIAL AI ARMS RACE
- STOCK MARKET INSTABILITY CAUSED BY ALGORITHMIC HIGH FREQUENCY TRADING
- ...
