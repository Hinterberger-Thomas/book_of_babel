# what is functional programming
In simple terms it is nothing more than [[pure functions]] and state that is [[immutability]]; Using these two options lead to better read- and maintainability. FP is inspired by mathematical functions, which always produce the same output, giving the same input. 

## why 
- State has to be immutabile and that leads to a better understanding of state changes.
- You always know what you gonna get. [[pure functions]] always produce predictable results
- Due to the nature of [[pure functions]] code is getting split into smaller bits and is, therefore, more readable
	- Easier testing (predictable behaviour)
	- [[pure functions]] do not depend on the global state, so they only need the necessary parameters
- The separation of logic and data makes code easier to read [[object oriented programming]]
- [[Thread safety]]; due to immutable state
